// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
read number1
read number2
perform addition operation
sum = number1+ number2
return sum result

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
read number to evaluate
read number
check if remainder of integer division equals 0 
the number is even
if number % 2 == 0 then return the number is even 
otherwise
else return the number is odd 

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
read number1
read number2
read number3
read number4
read number5

b) calculating average using the above numbers
to calculate average add up all the numbers and divide the result of the sum of by the number of numbers
average = (number1 + number2 + number3 + number4 + number5) / 5
print("the average is: ", average);

c) determining the minimum and maximum of the above numbers
Initialize min and max with number1
min = number1
max = number1

Compare min and max with the other numbers
if number2 < min then min = number2 
if number2 > max then max = number2
 
if number3 < min then min = number3
if number3 > max then max = number3

if number4 < min then min = number4
if number4 > max then max = number4

if number5 < min then min = number5
if number5 > max then max = number5

print("The minimum number is: ", min);
print("The maximum number is: ", max);
